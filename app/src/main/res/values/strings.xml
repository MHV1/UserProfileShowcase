    <string name="panda_description">The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also called the lesser panda,
        the red bear-cat, and the red cat-bear, is a mammal native to the eastern Himalayas and
        southwestern China. It has reddish-brown fur,
        a long, shaggy tail, and a waddling gait due to
        its shorter front legs; it is roughly the size of
        a domestic cat, though with a longer body and somewhat heavier.
        It is arboreal, feeds mainly on bamboo, but also eats eggs, birds,
        and insects. It is a solitary animal, mainly active from dusk to dawn,
        and is largely sedentary during the day.</string>
